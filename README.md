![FitBit Tracker](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.a3e06837f29dd2f6ac5fffeb4dd76323?rik=TA3NHdXufVkT%2fA&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)

## Introduction

The FitBit Tracker Insights project delves into the realm of wellness technology consumer behavior by analyzing Fitbit data. Fitbit, a widely-used wearable device, meticulously tracks various health and fitness metrics such as steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, and sleep duration. Through this analysis, we aim to extract valuable insights into users' activity patterns, sleep habits, and overall health.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Fitbit data, focusing on the following objectives:

1. Understanding users' activity patterns, encompassing steps taken, distance traveled, and intensity of physical activities.
2. Analyzing users' sleep habits, including the duration and quality of sleep.
3. Identifying correlations among different metrics tracked by Fitbit.
4. Classifying users based on their activity levels and the frequency of device usage.

## Data Description

**Data Collection:**

Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit

The Fitbit dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform for data science enthusiasts. It comprises minute-level output data for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring, collected via a distributed survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016. The dataset includes essential variables such as steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, sleep duration, and activity intensity.

**Data Loading:**
The dataset is loaded and processed using R programming in the R_notebook.ipynb file. Libraries such as tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization, lubridate for date manipulation, and ggplot2 for data visualization are utilized for effective analysis.

## Project Structure

This project follows a structured approach, consisting of the following phases:

1. **Ask Phase**: Defining the project objectives and framing research questions.
2. **Prepare Phase**: Collecting the Fitbit dataset from Kaggle, and cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
3. **Process Phase**: Conducting exploratory data analysis, visualizing trends, and uncovering patterns using R programming.
4. **Analyze Phase**: Deriving actionable insights from the data analysis and interpreting the findings.
5. **Share Phase**: Communicating the results through clear summaries, insightful visualizations, and actionable recommendations.
6. **Act Phase**: Providing recommendations to stakeholders based on the insights derived from the analysis.



## Conclusion

The FitBit Tracker Insights project offers valuable insights into consumer behavior related to wellness technology. By leveraging Fitbit data and conducting comprehensive analysis using R programming, we gain a deeper understanding of users' activity patterns and sleep habits. These insights can inform marketing strategies, product development efforts, and wellness initiatives to better cater to users' needs.
